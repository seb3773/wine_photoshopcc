# wine_photoshopcc
Photoshop CC 2020 wine installation.
  
This is a Photoshop CC 2020 installer for linux, with the help of wine :)  
The installer was designed for q4os trinity, but should work on any recent debian distro (maybe with some adjustements to the .desktop files).  
  
Instructions:  
  
clone the repository, an cd to the wine_photoshopcc folder  
set install_photoshop.sh executable: sudo chmod +x ./install_photoshop.sh  
launch the installer: ./install_photoshop.sh  
  
Enjoy.
